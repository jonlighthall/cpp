## For AI Agents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Project-wide facts, decisions, history |
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Procedures and standing orders |
| `<topic>/CONTEXT.md` | Topic-specific background |
| `<topic>/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Topic-specific procedures |

**Start here:** Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, then `CONTEXT.md`.

**Standing order:** When the user provides substantial context, integrate it into the appropriate file. See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details.

## For Humans

You have found your way into the back office.

This is where the machines keep their notes—records of decisions made, experiments tried, and the occasional heated discussion about whether `iostream` belongs in an Arduino library. (It does not. This was settled definitively and with great feeling.)

The files here are technically readable. They are not, however, interesting to you. They're the procedural equivalent of watching someone else's spreadsheet update in real time. Everything important has already been applied to the actual code.

**What you're looking for is elsewhere.**

The human-readable documentation lives in the parent directory. `README.md` for the overview, `docs/` for the technical details. This folder is just the filing cabinet.

*Do not delete this folder. Do not modify these files unless you are an AI agent operating under the standing orders defined herein.*

*Version history is tracked by git, not by timestamps in these files.*
