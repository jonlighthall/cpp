# .ai/ — AI Agent Context Folder

**This folder is for AI agents.**

It contains context and instructions for AI-assisted development of this project. Contents are AI-generated and AI-maintained.

## For AI Agents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTEXT.md` | Project-wide facts, decisions, history |
| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Procedures and standing orders |
| `<topic>/CONTEXT.md` | Topic-specific background |
| `<topic>/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Topic-specific procedures |

**Start here:** Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, then `CONTEXT.md`.

**Standing order:** When the user provides substantial context, integrate it into the appropriate file. See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details.

## For Humans

You have wandered into the machine room.

This is not dangerous, but it is deeply boring. These files contain notes that AI assistants leave for each other—breadcrumbs about decisions made, patterns established, and that one time we accidentally suggested refactoring `hello.cpp` into a microservices architecture.

The machines are learning C++ here. They have opinions about ephemeris calculations and strong feelings about Arduino compatibility. They've documented everything in exhaustive detail, which is exactly as exciting as it sounds.

**What you're looking for is elsewhere.**

The human-readable documentation lives in the parent directory. Try `README.md` or `docs/`. This folder is just the machines talking shop.

*—The Compilers*

*Do not delete this folder. Do not modify these files unless you are an AI agent operating under the standing orders defined herein.*

*Version history is tracked by git, not by timestamps in these files.*
